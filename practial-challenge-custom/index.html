        Meet the band!

    <h3>
        Justin
    </h3>
    <p>
        Justin was the one to start the band and never looked back since due to the limelight! Being and performing on stage is a feeling that no other can give him and what's better than doing so than with his brothers.

He learned how to sing classical jazz and R&B before transitioning to rock, but he still uses the techniques from different genres for more powerful runs and pushing vowels! He's been singing since he was five and can't wait to blow your expectations outta the way.

    <h3>
        Aidan
    </h3>
    <p>
        Meet our bassist, Aidan!
Wielding a shiny red bass and some sort of hat, Aidan always tries to bring a smile to his bandmates and audience. While most of his life was spent singing, he's been playing bass since he was 10 years old and has played in 2 other bands throughout his career.

Aidan spent all of high school in choir and has been following his dad's footsteps in mastering the bass. He's quick with a joke but faster with his fingers. Don't blink!
